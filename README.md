# Electronic_Waste_Recycling_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the recycling of electronic waste during the pandemic years 2020 and 2021. It looks at recycling trends across different regions and compares the performance of developed and developing countries. Using Power BI, the project identifies patterns in recycling rates and provides insights that can help improve global recycling efforts.

## Objectives
* Analyze Geographical Distribution: Investigate recycling rates across regions, highlighting differences in e-waste management between developed and developing countries.
* Examine Temporal Trends: Evaluate how recycling efforts evolved during the pandemic, comparing data from 2020 and 2021.
* Identify Key Drivers: Highlight regions with high recycling performance and explore factors contributing to their success.
* Compare the recycling efforts of developed and developing countries.

## Key Insights
* Developed regions like Europe showed high recycling rates during 2020 and 2021.
* Some developing countries reported higher recycling rates than expected, which raises questions about their methods and practices.
* Many countries kept their recycling rates stable, with only small changes between the two years.
* Despite global shutdowns, some regions managed to maintain high recycling rates, which reflects strong recycling systems.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Heat Maps will show recycling rates by region in 2020 and 2021.
* Bar Charts to compare trends between Developed and Developing regions.
* Maps to highlight the Geographical Variation in Electronic Waste Recycling.

## Recommendations
* Invest in better recycling systems for developing countries.
* Build partnerships between developed and developing nations to share technology and resources.
* Create policies that help sustain high recycling rates, even during challenging times.
* Raise awareness about the importance of recycling electronic waste to encourage more participation.

## Technologies Used
+ Power BI for creating interactive visualizations.
+ Global datasets on e-waste recycling from the SDG website (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database)
